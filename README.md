**Author**: Manuel S√°nchez Guti√©rrez  
**Date**: October 2024  
**Purpose**: Educational pentesting tool for TCP port scanning

---

## üìã Description

**Port Scanner** is a command-line tool written in Bash for scanning TCP ports on remote hosts. Developed as part of my training in **Network Systems Administration (ASIR)** and my specialization in **cybersecurity**.

This tool allows you to quickly identify which ports are open on a target system, as well as the services running on those ports.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Fast scanning** using Bash's native `/dev/tcp`
- ‚úÖ **Automatic service identification** via `/etc/services`
- ‚úÖ **Concurrent processing** (up to 100 simultaneous threads)
- ‚úÖ **Results export** to CSV format
- ‚úÖ **Colorful interface** for better terminal visualization
- ‚úÖ **Customizable port ranges**
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling**
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies** (Bash only)

---

## üöÄ Installation

### Requirements

- Operating system: Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux, etc.)
- Bash 4.0 or higher
- Execution permissions

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elabdera/port-scanner.git
cd port-scanner
```

2. Grant execution permissions:
```bash
chmod +x port_scanner.sh
```

3. Ready to use!

## üíª Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t <IP> -p <port_range>
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-t, --target IP` | Target host (required) | `-t 192.168.1.1` |
| `-p, --ports RANGE` | Port range (default: 1-1024) | `-p 1-1000` |
| `-o, --output FILE` | Save results to file | `-o results.txt` |
| `-h, --help` | Show help | `-h` |

### Usage Examples

**Scan common ports on a host:**
```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1024
```

**Scan specific ports:**
```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t scanme.nmap.org -p 20-100
```

**Scan and save results:**
```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t 10.0.0.1 -p 1-65535 -o scan_results.csv
```

**Scan common web ports:**
```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t example.com -p 80-443
```

## üîß Technical Operation

### Scanning Method

The script uses Bash's `/dev/tcp` feature to make TCP connections:

```bash
timeout 1 bash -c "echo >/dev/tcp/$host/$port" 2>/dev/null
```

If the connection succeeds (exit code 0), the port is open.

### Concurrent Processing

To speed up scanning, the script runs multiple checks in parallel:

```bash
check_port "$target" "$port" &

if [ $(jobs -r | wc -l) -ge 100 ]; then
    wait -n
fi
```

This allows scanning up to 100 ports simultaneously, significantly reducing total time.

### Service Identification

Services are identified by querying `/etc/services`:

```bash
service=$(grep -w "$port/tcp" /etc/services | awk '{print $1}' | head -n1)
```

---

## üìö Use Cases

### 1. Local Network Security Audit

Identify exposed services on devices in your network:

```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1024 -o router_scan.csv
```

### 2. Firewall Verification

Check if a firewall is correctly blocking certain ports:

```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t server.example.com -p 1-65535
```

### 3. Pentesting Reconnaissance (Lab)

Reconnaissance phase on practice virtual machines:

```bash
./port_scanner.sh -t 10.10.10.5 -p 1-10000 -o target_recon.csv
```
